# ChevyBot

A bot that helps you find a carpool ride on the [University of Waterloo Carpool Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/372772186164295/).

## TODO
1. Look up Facebook Graph API to figure out how to grab a more substantial list of posts in a group. (DONE)
2. Prettify resposes.
3. Widen dictionary vocabulary for locations as well as conversation.
4. Consider caching posts in a database server.
